<h1>Moving LLVM Projects to GitHub</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is a proposal to move our current revision control system from our own
hosted Subversion to GitHub. Below are the financial and technical arguments as
to why we are proposing such a move and how people (and validation
infrastructure) will continue to work with a Git-based LLVM.</p>

<p>There will be a survey pointing at this document which we'll use to gauge the
community's reaction and, if we collectively decide to move, the time-frame. Be
sure to make your view count.</p>

<p>Additionally, we will discuss this during a BoF at the next
<a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2016-11">US LLVM Developer meeting</a>.</p>

<p>This proposal is divided into the following parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Outline of the reasons to move to Git and GitHub</li>
<li>Description off the options</li>
<li>What examples of some workflows will look like (compared to currently)</li>
<li>The proposed migration plan</li>
</ul>

<h2>What This Proposal is *Not* About</h2>

<p>Changing the development policy.</p>

<p>This proposal relates only to moving the hosting of our source-code repository
from SVN hosted on our own servers to Git hosted on GitHub. We are not proposing
using GitHub's issue tracker, pull-requests, or code-review.</p>

<p>Contributers will continue to earn commit access on demand under the Developer
Policy, except that that a GitHub account will be required instead of SVN
username/password-hash.</p>

<h2>Why Git, and Why GitHub?</h2>

<h3>Why Move At All?</h3>

<p>This discussion began because we currently host host our own Subversion server
and Git mirror in a voluntary basis. The LLVM Foundation sponsors the server and
provides limited support, but there is only so much it can do.</p>

<p>Volunteers are not sysadmins themselves, but compiler engineers that happen
to know a thing or two about hosting servers. We also don't have 24/7 support,
and we sometimes wake up to see that continuous integration is broken because
the SVN server is either down or unresponsive.</p>

<p>We should take advantage of one of the services out there (GitHub, GitLab,
BitBucket among others) that offer that same service (24/7 stability, disk
space, Git server, code browsing, forking facilities, etc) for free.</p>

<h3>Why Git?</h3>

<p>Many new coders nowadays start with Git, and a lot of people have never used
SVN, CVS, or anything else. Websites like GitHub have changed the landscape
of open source contributions, reducing the cost of first contribution and
fostering collaboration.</p>

<p>Git is also the version control many LLVM developers use. Despite the
sources being stored in a SVN server, these developers are already using Git
through the Git-SVN integration.</p>

<p>Git allows you to:</p>

<ul>
<li> Commit, squash, merge, and fork locally without touching the remote server.</li>
<li> Maintain local branches, enabling multiple threads of development.</li>
<li> Collaborate on these branches (e.g. through your own fork of llvm on GitHub).</li>
<li> Inspect the repository history (blame, log, bisect) without Internet access.</li>
<li> Maintain remote forks and branches on Git hosting services and
  integrate back to the main repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, because Git seems to be replacing many OSS projects' version
control systems, there are many tools that are built over Git.
Future tooling may support Git first (if not only).</p>

<h3>Why GitHub?</h3>

<p>GitHub, like GitLab and BitBucket, provides free code hosting for open source
projects. Any of these could replace the code-hosting infrastructure that we
have today.</p>

<p>These services also have a dedicated team to monitor, migrate, improve and
distribute the contents of the repositories depending on region and load.</p>

<p>GitHub has one important advantage over GitLab and
BitBucket: it offers read-write <b>SVN</b> access to the repository
(https://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support).
This would enable people to continue working post-migration as though our code
were still canonically in an SVN repository.</p>

<p>In addition, there are already multiple LLVM mirrors on GitHub, indicating that
part of our community has already settled there.</p>

<h3>On Managing Revision Numbers with Git</h3>

<p>The current SVN repository hosts all the LLVM sub-projects alongside each other.
A single revision number (e.g. r123456) thus identifies a consistent version of
all LLVM sub-projects.</p>

<p>Git does not use sequential integer revision number but instead uses a hash to
identify each commit. (Linus
<a href="http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/Git-commit-generation-numbers-td6584414.html">mentioned</a>
that the lack of such revision number is "the only real design mistake" in Git.)</p>

<p>The loss of a sequential integer revision number has been a sticking point in
past discussions about Git:</p>

<ul>
<li>"The 'branch' I most care about is mainline, and losing the ability to say
  'fixed in r1234' (with some sort of monotonically increasing number) would
  be a tragic loss."
  (<a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2011-July/041739.html">Chris Lattner</a>)</li>
<li>"I like those results sorted by time and the chronology should be obvious, but
  timestamps are incredibly cumbersome and make it difficult to verify that a
  given checkout matches a given set of results."
  (<a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2011-July/041721.html">Andrew Trick</a>)</li>
<li>"There is still the major regression with unreadable version numbers.
  Given the amount of Bugzilla traffic with 'Fixed in...', that's a
  non-trivial issue." (<a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2011-July/041688.html">Joerg Sonnenberg</a>)</li>
<li>"Sequential IDs are important for LNT and llvmlab bisection tool." (<a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2016-July/049886.html">Chris Matthews</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, Git can emulate this increasing revision number:
`git rev-list  --count <commit-hash>`. This identifier is unique only within a
single branch, but this means the tuple `(num, branch-name)` uniquely identifies
a commit.</p>

<p>We can thus use this revision number to ensure that e.g. `clang -v` reports a
user-friendly revision number (e.g. `master-12345` or `4.0-5321`), addressing
the objections raised above with respect to this aspect of Git.</p>

<h3>What About Branches and Merges?</h3>

<p>In contrast to SVN, Git makes branching easy. Git's commit history is represented
as a DAG, a departure from SVN's linear history.</p>

<p>However, to avoid controversy, the scope of this proposal excludes merge
commits and mandates a linear history in our canonical Git repository.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, GitHub does not support server side hooks to enforce such a
policy.  We must rely on the community to avoid pushing merge commits.</p>

<p>GitHub offers a feature called
	<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-required-status-checks/">Status Checks</a>: 
a branch protected by status checks requires commits to be whitelisted before
the push can happen. We could supply a pre-push hook on the client side that
would run and check the history, before whitelisting the commit being pushed.
However this solution would be somewhat fragile (how do you update a script
installed on every developer machine?) and prevents SVN access to the
repository.</p>

<h3>What About Commit Emails?</h3>

<p>We will need a new bot to send emails for each commit. This proposal leaves the
email format unchanged besides the commit URL.</p>

<h2>Straw Man Migration Plan</h2>

<p>STEP #1 : Before The Move</p>

<ol>
<li>Update docs to mention the move, so people are aware of what is going on.</li>
<li>Set up a read-only version of the GitHub project, mirroring our current SVN
   repository.</li>
<li>Add the required bots to implement the commit emails, as well as the
   umbrella repository update (if the multirepo is selected) or the read-only
   Git views for the sub-projects (if the monorepo is selected).</li>
</ol>

<p>STEP #2 : Git Move</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Update the buildbots to pick up updates and commits from the GitHub
   repository. Not all bots have to migrate at this point, but it'll help
   provide infrastructure testing.</li>
<li>Update Phabricator to pick up commits from the GitHub repository.</li>
<li>LNT and llvmlab have to be updated: they rely on unique monotonically
   increasing integer across branch [MatthewsRevNum]_.</li>
<li>Instruct downstream integrators to pick up commits from the GitHub
   repository.</li>
<li>Review and prepare an update for the LLVM documentation.</li>
</ol>
	
<p>Until this point nothing has changed for developers, it will just
boil down to a lot of work for buildbot and other infrastructure
owners.</p>

<p>Once all dependencies are cleared, and all problems have been solved:</p>

<p>STEP #3: Write Access Move</p>

<ol start="9">
<li>Collect developers' GitHub account information, and add them to the project.</li>
<li>Switch the SVN repository to read-only and allow pushes to the GitHub repository.</li>
<li>Update the documentation.</li>
<li>Mirror Git to SVN.</li>
</ol>

<p>STEP #4 : Post Move</p>

<ol start="13">
<li>Archive the SVN repository.</li>
<li>Update links on the LLVM website pointing to viewvc/klaus/phab etc. to
    point to GitHub instead.</li>
</ol>

<h2>One or Multiple Repositories?</h2>

<p>There are two major proposals for how to structure our Git repository: The
"multirepo" and the "monorepo".</p>

<ol>
<li>*Multirepo* - Moving each SVN sub-project into its own separate Git repository.</li>
<li>*Monorepo* - Moving all the LLVM sub-projects into a single Git repository.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first proposal would mimic the existing official separate read-only Git
repositories (e.g. http://llvm.org/git/compiler-rt.git), while the second one
would mimic an export of the SVN repository (i.e. it would look similar to
https://github.com/llvm-project/llvm-project, where each sub-project has its own
top-level directory).</p>

<p>With the Monorepo, the existing single-subproject mirrors (e.g.
http://llvm.org/git/compiler-rt.git) with git-svn read-write access would
continue to be maintained: developers would continue to be able to use the
existing single-subproject git repositories as they do today, with *no changes
to workflow*. Everything (git fetch, git svn dcommit, etc.) would continue to
work identically to how it works today.</p>

<p>There are other consequences: having all the code in a single checkout
imply that "git grep" works across sub-projects for instance. This can be used
for example to find refactoring opportunities across projects (for example
reusing a datastructure initially in LLDB by moving it into libSupport, or to
decide to extract some pieces of libSupport and/or ADT to a new top-level
*independent* library that can be reused in libcxxabi).
Finally, it encourages maintaining other sub-projects when changing API.</p>

<p>As another example, some developers think that the division between e.g. clang
and clang-tools-extra is not useful. With the monorepo, we can move code around
as we wish and preserve history.
With the multirepo, refactoring some functions from clang to make it part of a
utility in libSupport to share it across sub-projects
wouldn't carry the history of the code in the llvm repo, breaking recursively
applying `git blame` for instance.</p>

<p>Some concerns have been raised that having a single repository would be a burden
for downstream users that have interest in only a single repository, however
this is addressed by keeping the single-subproject Git mirrors for each project
just as we do today. Also the GitHub SVN bridge allows to contribute to a single
sub-project the same way it is possible today (see below before/after section
for more details).</p>

<p>Finally, nobody will be forced to compile projects they don't want to build.
The exact structure is TBD, but even if you use the monorepo directly, we'll
ensure that it's easy to set up your build to compile only a few particular
sub-projects.</p>

<h3>How Do We Handle A Single Revision Number Across Multiple Repositories?</h3>

<p>A key need is to be able to check out multiple projects (i.e. lldb+llvm or
clang+llvm+libcxx for example) at a specific revision.</p>

<p>Under the monorepo, this is a non-issue.  That proposal maintains the property of
the existing SVN repository that the sub-projects move synchronously, and a
single revision number (or commit hash) identifies the state of the development
across all projects.</p>

<p>Under the multirepo, it is not as straightforward (but the infrastructure will
hide the complexity from the end-user).  We describe here the proposed solution.</p>

<p>A tuple of revisions (one entry per repository) is sufficient to describe the
state across separated Git repositories/sub-projects.
For example, a given version of clang would be
*<LLVM-12345, clang-5432, libcxx-123, etc.>*.</p>

<p>To make this more convenient, a separate *umbrella* repository would be
provided. This repository would be used for the sole purpose of understanding
the approximate sequence (commits from different repositories pushed around the
same time can appear in different orders) in which commits were pushed to the
different repositories and to provide a single revision number.</p>

<p>This umbrella repository will be read-only and continuously updated
to record the above tuple. The proposed form to record this is to use
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">Git submodules</a>,
possibly along with a set of scripts to help check out a specific revision of
the LLVM distribution.</p>

<p>A regular LLVM developer does not need to interact with the umbrella repository
-- the individual repositories can be checked out independently -- but you would
need to use the umbrella repository to bisect or to check out old revisions of
llvm plus another sub-project at a consistent version.</p>

<p>This umbrella repository will be updated automatically by a bot (running on
notice from a webhook on every push, and periodically). The umbrella repository
would be updated on a per commit basis: a single commit in the umbrella
repository would match a single commit in a subproject. Note however that
commits in different repositories may be visible in undefined order in the
umbrella repository, and also that you can't have a single cross-projects commit
that would update both LLVM and another subprojects.</p>

<p>Later sections illustrates how end-users would interact with this repository for
various use-cases, and the `Previews`_ section links to a usable repository
illustrating this structure.</p>

<h2>Previews</h2>

</pre>

<p>Commits are performed using `svn commit` or with the sequence `git commit` and
`git svn dcommit`.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>With the multirepo proposal, nothing changes but the URL, and commits can be
performed using `svn commit` or `git commit` and `git push`:</p>

<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm.git llvm
  # or using the GitHub svn native bridge
  svn co https://github.com/llvm/llvm/trunk/ llvm
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<p>With the monorepo, there are multiple possibilities to achieve this.  First,
you could just clone the full repository:</p>

<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-projects.git llvm
  # or using the GitHub svn native bridge
  svn co https://github.com/llvm/llvm-projects/trunk/ llvm
</pre>

<p>At this point you have every sub-project (llvm, clang, lld, lldb, ...), which
<b>doesn't imply you have to build all of them</b>. You can still build only
compiler-rt for instance. In this way it's not different from someone who would
check out all the projects with SVN today.</p>

<p>You can commit as normal using `git commit` and `git push` or `svn commit`, and
read the history for a single project (`git log libcxx` for example).</p>

<p>There are a few options to avoid checking out all the sources.</p>

<p>First, you could hide the other directories using a Git sparse checkout:</p>

<pre>
  git config core.sparseCheckout true
  echo /compiler-rt > .git/info/sparse-checkout
  git read-tree -mu HEAD
</pre>

<p>The data for all sub-projects is still in your `.git` directory, but in your
checkout, you only see `compiler-rt`.
Before you push, you'll need to fetch and rebase (`git pull --rebase`) as
usual.</p>

<p>Note that when you fetch you'll likely pull in changes to sub-projects you don't
care about. If you are using spasre checkout, the files from other projects
won't appear on your disk. The only effect is that your commit hash changes.</p>

<p>You can check whether the changes in the last fetch are relevant to your commit
by running:</p>

<pre>
  git log origin/master@{1}..origin/master -- libcxx
</pre>

<p>This command can be hidden in a script so that `git llvmpush` would perform all
these steps, fail only if such a dependent change exists, and show immediately
the change that prevented the push. An immediate repeat of the command would
(almost) certainly result in a successful push.
Note that today with SVN or git-svn, this step is not possible since the
"rebase" implicitly happens while committing (unless a conflict occurs).</p>

<p>A second option is to use svn via the GitHub svn native bridge:</p>

<pre>
  svn co https://github.com/llvm/llvm-projects/trunk/compiler-rt compiler-rt  —username=...
</pre>

<p>This checks out only compiler-rt and provides commit access using "svn commit",
in the same way as it would do today.</p>

<p>Finally, you could use *git-svn* and one of the sub-project mirrors:</p>

<pre>
  # Clone from the single read-only Git repo
  git clone http://llvm.org/git/llvm.git
  cd llvm
  # Configure the SVN remote and initialize the svn metadata
  $ git svn init https://github.com/joker-eph/llvm-project/trunk/llvm —username=...
  git config svn-remote.svn.fetch :refs/remotes/origin/master
  git svn rebase -l
</pre>

<p>In this case the repository contains only a single sub-project, and commits can
be made using `git svn dcommit`, again exactly as we do today.</p>

<p>At this point the clang, llvm, and libcxx individual repositories are cloned
and stored alongside each other. There are CMake flags to describe the directory
structure; alternatively, you can just symlink `clang` to `llvm/tools/clang`,
etc.</p>

  git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="2009-07-27 13:37" master`

<p>SVN does not have builtin bisection support, but the single revision across
sub-projects makes it straightforward to script around.</p>

<p>Using the existing Git read-only
view of the repositories, it is possible to use the native Git bisection script
over the llvm repository, and use some scripting to synchronize the clang
repository to match the llvm revision.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>With the multi-repositories proposal, the cross-repository synchronization is
achieved using the umbrella repository. This repository contains only
submodules for the other sub-projects. The native Git bisection can be used on
the umbrella repository directly. A subtlety is that the bisect script itself
needs to make sure the submodules are updated accordingly.</p>

<p>For example, to find which commit introduces a regression where clang-3.9
crashes but not clang-3.8 passes, one should be able to simply do:</p>

<pre>
  git bisect start release_39 release_38
  git bisect run ./bisect_script.sh
</pre>

<p>With the `bisect_script.sh` script being:</p>

<pre>
  #!/bin/sh
  cd $UMBRELLA_DIRECTORY
  git submodule update llvm clang libcxx #....
  cd $BUILD_DIR

  ninja clang || exit 125   # an exit code of 125 asks "git bisect"
                            # to "skip" the current commit

  ./bin/clang some_crash_test.cpp
</pre>

<p>When the `git bisect run` command returns, the umbrella repository is set to
the state where the regression is introduced, one can inspect the history on
every sub-project compared to the previous revision in the umbrella (commits

<p>Bisecting on the monorepo is straightforward and almost identical to the
multirepo situation explained above. The bisection script does not need to
include the `git submodule update` step.</p>

<p>Also, since the monorepo handles commits update across multiple projects, you're
less like to encounter a build failure where a commit change an API in LLVM and
another later one "fixes" the build in clang.</p>

<h3>Living Downstream</h3>

<p>Depending on which of the multirepo or the monorepo proposal gets accepted,
and depending on the integration scheme, downstream projects may be differently
impacted and have different options.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you were pulling from the SVN repo before the switch to Git. The monorepo
  will allow you to continue to use SVN the same way. The main caveat is that
  you'll need to be prepared for a one-time change to the revision numbers.
  The multirepo proposal still offers an SVN access to each individual
  sub-project, but the SVN revision for each sub-project won't be synchronized.
</li>
<li>If you were pulling from one of the existing read-only Git repos, this also
  will continue to work as before as they will continue to exist in both of the
  proposals.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the monorepo proposal, you have a third option: migrating your fork to
the monorepo. If your fork touches multiple LLVM projects, migrating your fork
into the mono repo would enable you to make commits that touch multiple projects
at the same time the same way LLVM contributors would be able to do so.</p>
<p>As a demonstration, we've migrated the "CHERI" fork to the monorepo in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using a script that
  <a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-July/102787.html">rewrites history</a>
  (including merges) so that it looks like the fork always lived in the
  monorepo.  The upside of this is when you check out an old revision, you get a
  copy of all llvm sub-projects at a consistent revision.  (For instance, if
  it's a clang fork, when you check out an old revision you'll get a consistent
  version of llvm proper.)  The downside is that this changes the fork's commit
  hashes.
</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-July/102804.html">
  Merging the fork into the monorepo</a>.  This preserves the fork's
  commit hashes, but when you check out an old commit you only get the one
  sub-project.
</ul>

<p>If you keep a split-repository solution downstream, upstreaming patches to
the monorepo is always possible (the splitrepo is obvious): you can apply the
patches in the appropriate subdirectory of the monorepo (using either
`git am --directory=...` or plain `diff` and `patch`).</p>

<h2>Multi/Mono Hybrid Variant</h2>

<p>A variant of the monorepo proposal is to group together in a single repository
only the projects that are *rev-locked* to LLVM (clang, lld, lldb, ...) and
leave projects like libcxx and compiler-rt in their own individual and separate
repositories.</p>

<p>Note that even within the monorepo, developers who hack only on one of these
sub-projects can continue to use the single sub-project Git mirrors, and commit
through git-svn so their workflow is unchanged.
(That is, they aren't forced to download or check out all of llvm, clang, etc.
just to make a change to libcxx.)</p>
